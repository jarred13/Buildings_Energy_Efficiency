# Buildings_Energy_Efficiency

In the 21th century will we need to be more efficient with our energy use. This project uses machine learning to predict the energy efficiency of a building. The idea is that we can use these predictions to help with designing and building more efficient buildings.

This project consist of:
* a Kaggle notebook
* R script which I wrote the code with
* R markdown and PDF to show results
* CSV file of the data
